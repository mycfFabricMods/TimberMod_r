# How to request compatible mods

Hello everyone.  
If you want my mod to support antoher mod please reach out to the developers of the mod.

What they need to do:
1. Create a tag with path:  
`data/minecraft/tags/blocks`
2. Depending on whether the logs burn or don't burn they should add their logs to either `logs_that_burn.json` or `logs.json`

**Most likely the developers will know what to do**, so a 
"Can you please create tags for you logs so that this and that mod is compatible? That would be greatly appreciated!" is probably sufficient.

Have a nice day cutting wood!
