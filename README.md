# How to request compatible mods

Hello everyone.\
Please create a new issue for **each** mod you want support for. Please keep in mind, that I do this in my free time and just because you 
requested a mod there is no gurantee that I'll really add it.

# Make those things sure before you request a mod
1. Make sure the soruce code is publicy availabe
2. Make sure its a **fabric** mod
3. Make sure the mod is available in your preferred version.

Regarding point 3.: Normally I will only add support for the newest versions, however there are exceptions.

# How the issue should look like
1. Name of the Mod
2. Link to the mod
3. Preferred Version
